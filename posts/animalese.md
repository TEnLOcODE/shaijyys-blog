# Welcome back to the Shaijyy!  
We all know and love Nintendo Games,  
but did you know that this giberish weird language from the Animal Crossing V.G. series,  
is actually a language that can even be translated!  

# What??  
Turns out, while working on the original Japanese Animal Crossing game,  
The game's sound effects manager - Taro Bando (japanese: 阪東 太郎, Bandō tarō)  
wanted to make the game's NPCs (Non Playable Character) speak Japanese out loud,  
and he knew that it would be much easier to synthesise Japanese compared to English.  
Take this letter for example:  
か  Ka.  
no matter what, this letter will always make the same sound, Ka.  
but in English...  
Some letters can make completely different sounds!  
For example, A, and G:  
  
Letter | sound #1 | sound #2 | sound #3 | sound #4  
---|---|---|---|---  
A|ah|ar|uh|ay  
G|gh|jh|kh|silence  
  
Let's say the computer wants to say the phrase "Good morning."  
it will have to check whether it's Good, Jood, Gooood, oood,  
and in Japanese, the phrase "Good morning." (おはよう, Ohayō ooh)  
all you have to do is to record every sound and make the computer play it at the right speed and order.  
And so, Taro Bando finished his Japanese synthesiser,  
but he and his team could not sync up the text with the audio, It was just too quick.  
but then...  
they remembered something...  
it is a game about animals!!  
and animals don't talk, do they?  
but instead of scrapping off the idea entirely, they just made the talking even FASTER!  
in fact, so fast that you could not even understand it without slowing it down!  
they played a bit with the pitch of the audio, and BHAM!  
Animalese was invented!  
In fact, Nintendo was so happy with Animalese, they decided to PATENT IT!

# Cool, but what do YOU have to do with this?  
Well, I found this really cool project by Acedio on GitHub that basically synthesises Animalese!  
[Check it out!](http://acedio.github.io/animalese.js/)  
But when I checked its code, I saw that it is not really Animalese,  
his project uses a prerecorded sped up audio file and just cuts it to say thing in plain English.  

  
**I** want to create a project that actually uses Google's APIs to translate text to Japanese, say it, speed it up, change its pitch, slow it down  
to output REAL Animalese.  
Anyway, thanks for reading,  
Have a good one.
