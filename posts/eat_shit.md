I already got enough "Free Palestine", "Support Gaza", "Israel are Terrorists" emails from pro-palestinian websites that I signed up for before the war started.  
I don't need you suckers to do it too.  
Every mail I'll get mentioning Air 💨 I- I MEAN PALESTINE will be blocked and reported as spam to the mail domain admins.  

Just wanted to say that yes, I DO live in Israel, yes, I AM Jewish and I'm also proud of that.  

Now let me **FINALLY** finish my English homework that I have to do before my teacher kicks me out of class.  

Thanks for literally NOTHING,  
The Shaijyy Team  
( and by team I mean me and my dog 🐶 )
