accidentally minted 1,000,000 tokens on a testnet.  
giving 100,000 SHJY for free!  
built on Sepolia testnet..  
# How do I get some?  
just email me at: (shaijyy@duck.com)[mailto:shaijyy@duck.com].  
explain nicely that you want some,  
(don't forget to include your SepoliaETH address)  
and I'll (manually) give you 100,000 Shaijyy Coins ($SHJY) in 1-3 days!  
# How do I know that it's not a scam??  
It is built accidentally on a testnet, meaning that it's worth nothing.  
this is not considered scamming in any way, since I don't ask YOU to give ME anything.  
completely free (for me and you) and worth nothing (again, for me and you, that's why I want to get rid of it...)  
just want to get rid of it.  
# If it's worth nothing, why would I want it?  
cuz it's cool to have crypto, and it's completely free in this case.
