# Welcome!  
Hello, I am Eitan ( aka. Shaijyy ) from Jerusalem,  
A fullstack Python developer with about ~5 years of experience or so ( as I'm writing this ⊂(◉‿◉)つ )  
I made this sort of... mini blog using a special custom made version of denoblog I made.  
( and yes, this is powered by deno & deno deploy, and yes, this is open source. )  

I'll try to upload daily posts starting February 1st, 2024.  
These posts will have cool tricks, tutorials and other cool stuff so check it out once a while!  

Feel free to contact me at: [shaijyy@duck.com](mailto:shaijyy@duck.com/).  

So, that's all for now.  
Thanks for reading,  
Eitan B.
